        <p class="A">
            <strong>Rath Yatra</strong>, also known as the Chariot Festival, is a major Hindu festival dedicated to 
            <strong>Lord Jagannath</strong>, an avatar of Lord Vishnu. It is celebrated annually in 
            <strong>Puri, Odisha</strong>, and other places, where grand processions feature chariots carrying the deities 
            <strong>Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra</strong>. The festival represents the journey of the deities from their 
            temple to their aunt's house â€” the Gundicha Temple.
